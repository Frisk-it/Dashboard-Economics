# Project: Economic Analysis and Decision-Making Tool for Software Projects

## Project Overview

Develop an interactive software tool to help software engineering teams evaluate economic decisions throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This tool will encompass various economic models and analyses, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding project budgeting, scheduling, resource allocation, and risk management.

## Objectives

-   Apply economic concepts to practical software engineering scenarios.
-   Provide students hands-on experience in economic modeling, cost estimation, and decision-making.
-   Develop analytical skills through the implementation and evaluation of economic decision-making models.

## Core Components

### 1. Cost Estimation Module

-   Implement multiple cost estimation techniques:
    -   **Empirical Estimation:** COCOMO, Function Points
    -   **Heuristic Estimation:** Expert Judgment, Delphi Method
    -   **Analytical Mathematical Models:** Regression Analysis
-   Allow users to input project attributes and compare outputs from different models.

### 2. Budgeting and Cost Management

-   Develop tools for managing project budgets:
    -   Calculate **Return on Investment (ROI)**, **Net Present Value (NPV)**, **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**, and **Payback Period**.
    -   Implement budget tracking, variance analysis, and forecasting modules.

### 3. Risk Management Module

-   Integrate risk assessment and analysis techniques:
    -   Sensitivity Analysis
    -   Decision Trees
    -   Monte Carlo Simulation for uncertainty modeling
-   Visualize outcomes for stakeholders clearly.

### 4. Resource Allocation & Optimization

-   Build a model to optimize resource scheduling and allocation:
    -   Implement resource leveling and resource smoothing algorithms.
    -   Allow scenario analysis to balance costs versus schedules and resources.

## Project Deliverables

1.  **A proposal document** explaining how the group will implement the project.
2.  **Interactive Web-based Application**
    -   Intuitive GUI with clear visualization of analysis outcomes.
    -   Backend calculations and data management using Python or Node.js with a database.
3.  **Comprehensive Documentation**
    -   Technical Documentation detailing models, algorithms, and calculations.
    -   User Manual for effective usage.
4.  **Presentation and Demonstration**
    -   Final presentation highlighting key findings, economic analyses, and scenario outcomes.

## Example Scenario

Students create a fictional software project, such as a mobile application or a cloud-based service. They input various project parameters into the tool, such as team size, estimated lines of code, timeframes, resources costs, and risks. The tool calculates:

-   Estimated total costs using multiple models.
-   Budget allocation and tracking through project phases.
-   Economic metrics (ROI, NPV) based on projected revenues and costs.
-   Risk probabilities and financial impacts, visualized through simulations.
-   Resource optimization scenarios showing potential cost-savings and schedule impacts.

## Technologies Recommended

-   **Frontend:** React or Angular
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Python Flask or Django
-   **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL
-   **Visualization:** Chart.js or D3.js
-   **Deployment:** Vercel for Next.js web application
-   **AI Editor:** Cursor or Windsurf

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, students will:

-   Understand the application of economic theory in software engineering contexts.
-   Be adept at interpreting economic data and making informed project decisions.
-   Gain practical experience in full-stack application development integrating economic modeling.
