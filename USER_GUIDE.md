## Cost Estimation

### Overview

The Cost Estimation module helps you predict software project costs using industry-standard models and methodologies.

### Available Models

#### 1. COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)

**Basic COCOMO:**
- Simple effort estimation based on lines of code
- Suitable for preliminary estimates
- Uses three project types: Organic, Semi-detached, Embedded

**Intermediate COCOMO:**
- More detailed estimation with effort multipliers
- Considers various cost drivers
- Provides more accurate estimates

**How to Use:**
1. Select "COCOMO" estimation model
2. Enter project parameters:
   - Lines of Code (KLOC)
   - Project type (Organic/Semi-detached/Embedded)
   - Team experience level
   - Product complexity
3. Configure effort multipliers if using Intermediate COCOMO
4. Click "Calculate" to generate estimates

#### 2. Function Points

**Purpose:**
- Size measurement independent of programming language
- Based on user functionality rather than technical implementation

**Steps:**
1. Select "Function Points" model
2. Count and classify:
   - External Inputs (EI)
   - External Outputs (EO)
   - External Inquiries (EQ)
   - Internal Logical Files (ILF)
   - External Interface Files (EIF)
3. Apply complexity weights
4. Calculate Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)
5. Apply Technical Complexity Factor (TCF)

#### 3. Regression Analysis

**Use Cases:**

- Custom organizational models
- Trend analysis

**Process:**
1. Upload historical project data
2. Select variables for analysis
3. Choose regression model type
4. Generate prediction equations
5. Apply to new projects

## Financial Analysis

### Overview

The Financial Analysis module provides comprehensive tools for evaluating the economic viability of software projects and making investment decisions.

### Key Metrics

#### 1. Return on Investment (ROI)

**Formula:** ROI = (Net Profit / Total Investment) Ã— 100

**How to Calculate:**
1. Navigate to Financial Analysis
2. Enter project investment costs:
   - Development costs
   - Infrastructure costs
   - Operational costs
3. Enter expected returns:
   - Revenue projections
   - Cost savings
   - Efficiency gains
4. Select time period for analysis
5. Click "Calculate ROI"

**Interpretation:**
- Positive ROI indicates profitable investment
- Higher percentages indicate better returns
- Compare with alternative investments

#### 2. Net Present Value (NPV)

**Purpose:** Evaluates the profitability of an investment by considering the time value of money

**Inputs Required:**
- Initial investment amount
- Expected cash flows by period
- Discount rate (cost of capital)
- Project duration

**Steps:**
1. Enter initial investment
2. Input projected cash flows for each period
3. Set appropriate discount rate
4. Calculate NPV

**Interpretation:**
- Positive NPV: Project adds value
- Negative NPV: Project destroys value
- Higher NPV indicates better investment

#### 3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Definition:** The discount rate that makes NPV equal to zero

**When to Use:**
- Comparing projects with different scales
- Setting minimum acceptable returns
- Capital rationing decisions

**Calculation Process:**
1. Enter project cash flows
2. Set initial investment
3. Calculate IRR automatically
4. Compare with required rate of return

#### 4. Payback Period

**Simple Payback:**
- Time to recover initial investment
- Ignores time value of money
- Easy to understand and calculate

**Discounted Payback:**
- Considers time value of money
- More accurate but complex
- Better for long-term projects

### Advanced Financial Features
